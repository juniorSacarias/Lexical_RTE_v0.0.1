4. Version initial ( v0.0.1 )

   In the initial version I have developed 90% of the functionalities that it should have in addition to a time tracker which allows us to advance or go back steps if necessary
   Below I will develop all the functionalities one by one together with an example video

   1. Text and change its size

      In this version we are able to enter text without restriction in addition to being able to change the size between two available options. For the moment, if it is a single word or we want the entire text to change size, we only have to press H1 or H2 and if we want to return it to its original size press "T"

4. Improvements and future versions

   As we have seen, this component is still very green and needs polishing, developing existing functionalities and adding new ones. That is why little by little I will add the different changes to the repository. The final goal is to obtain a complete component but currently version 0.0.1 has been generated as an MVP.

   Features pending development or improvement:
   
        a. Font management system through a dialog with a relationship of numbers
        b. Font selection system like Roboto
        c. Improve imaging system
        d. Improve the code section
